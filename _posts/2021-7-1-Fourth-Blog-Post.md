### What would you do differently?

It would be helpful for me to learn more about how to resolve conflict merge issues and discuss the matter with my team members to learn how to avoid this.

### What was the most difficulte part for you?

For me, the most difficult part is working with GitHub in a team. We may encounter merge conflict issues. If it's a one-person project, the problem does not exist. But because it's a team project, I don't want to accidentally delete my team member's code. And to commit my code to the repo, I must resolve this issue. This is the most challenging part for me.

### What are your big take-aways from this project?

I will learn more about how to resolve conflict merge issues. For group projects, this is extremely important. I will probably participate in many group projects using GitHub in the future. Finding a solution to this issue will be beneficial to the project.
