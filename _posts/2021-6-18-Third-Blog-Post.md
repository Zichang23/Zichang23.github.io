### Explain what you did in the project and any interesting finding 

The work I did: Created my project in RStudio and my GitHub repo, linked RStudio to GitHub, wrote functions to contact APIs, performed some basic exploratory analysis, contributed several commits to GitHub, created GitHub pages repo, and wrote this blog.

Interesting thing: It is really interesting to be able to do my project in RStudio, and then update my work to GitHub and create web pages (GitHub pages).

### Reflections on completing this project

#### 1. What was the most difficulte part of the logic and programming for you?

For me, the most challenging part is figuring out how to create the functions to contact the NHL records API. I need to know how to code the input "name and ID number" and how to map the name to the ID.

#### 2. What would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

I will do my best to understand the requirements for the project. This will help me understand what I need to do and how to accomplish the project.
