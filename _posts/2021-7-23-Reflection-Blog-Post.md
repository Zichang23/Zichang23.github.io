#### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

I now have a better understanding of what a data scientist does. The job requirements for data scientists are pretty high and the work they do is extremely versatile. They should have knowledge in a broad range of areas, such as mathematics, statistics, and subject expertise, and strong computer science and coding skills.

#### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

One semester of studying R has opened my eyes to how powerful R is. Before taking this course, my understanding of R was calculation, model selection, and fitting. It never crossed my mind that I could use R to generate beautiful pdf files, HTML pages, or even an app. I really enjoy using R to create shiny apps.

I will certainly continue to use R in my future work and study. I can perform statistical computing and analysis more efficiently, generate various numerical and graphical summaries of data, and present my results in various formats, including PDF reports, HTML pages, and interactive shiny apps. It will definitely benefit me in the long run.

#### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
R will be used more in my life since it is such a powerful tool.
