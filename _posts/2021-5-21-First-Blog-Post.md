1.What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

Data scientist gathers data from multiple sources and applies machine learning, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets. They understand data from a business point of view and can provide accurate predictions and insights that can be used to power critical business decisions.

2.What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

Major duties: analyzing data, providing business insights, and prototyping models

Knowledge areas: math and statistics, subject expertise (knowledge about the domain to abstract and calculate), and hacking skills (machine learning, Python, SAS, R, Scala)

3.What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
Differences: 

Statisticians need to understand the modeling and structure of data, while data scientists need to understand applied statistics. 

Statisticians deal with nebulous concepts (e.g. point estimates, margin of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing), while data scientists is more approachable (data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling)

Different means of data collection: 
Data scientists: the amount of data is often massive, consequently, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation. 
Statisticians: still rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments.

Different approach to building and testing their models:
Data scientists: typically data science problems are formulated using a modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model. Data scientists do this by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy.
Statisticians: the starting point in statistics is usually a simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. The model is improved by addressing assumptions in the model that are violated. The modeling process is considered complete when all model assumptions are verified and no assumptions are violated.

Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, while statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data.

Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists.

Different nomenclature to describe the same principles:
Data scientists speak of things like: “example” whereas statisticians use “observation,” “feature” versus “predictor” or “independent variable,” “label” versus “response” or “dependent variable.”

Similarities:
Both have appropriate training in statistics, need to know how to work with real-world data, and tend to gather information for similar purpose.

4.How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I consider myself have closer relation to statistics than to data science since I am majored in statistics. I use traditional and small scale methods of data collection, I address violated assumptions to improve model, I focus on quantifying uncertainty, and I use terms, such as, observation, predictor, response, and dependent variables.
