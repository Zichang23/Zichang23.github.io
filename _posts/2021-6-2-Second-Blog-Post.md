#### What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
R: free, easy to learn, has the largest online community, and gets the latest features fast.  
SAS: it is not free. It has dedicated customer service in addition to the community. It upgrades its abilities in new variation rollouts.


#### What functionality do you like about R?  
It is quite flexible. There are many ways to achieve the same goal. 
It can be easily extended through functions and extensions.  
Many user-created packages extend the capabilities of R.  


#### What parts do you miss about your other language?   
SAS is not difficult to learn and supplies simple choice.  
SAS can produce a lot of fancy outputs.  
SAS release upgrades in managing the environment. Thus, they are well analyzed, which eliminates the opportunities for mistakes.

#### Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.).   
I knew R in previous courses. At that time, I hadn't had the opportunity to learn it systematically. 
As a result, I find it difficult to understand and write R code myself. So far in this course, I do not think R is a difficult language to learn. 
Later, I may change my mind. But I believe that, as I practice more, I will become more proficient at R programming.
